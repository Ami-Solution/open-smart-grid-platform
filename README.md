# Protocol Adapter for Open Street Light Protocol
---

These components offer an implementation of OSLP. There's the Protocol Adapter that can map a domain message to a OSLP message and send it to a SSLD/PSLD smart device. For development and testing there's the Device Simulator that has similar interface and behaviour as SSLD/PSLD smart devices.

The components have dependencies.
