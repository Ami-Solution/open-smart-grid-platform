!2 Narrative
As an operator I want to log in

!3 Description
The platform has the concept of organisations, each with it's own unique identity. 
The operator has a separate application and it's own identity on the platform. 
As the operator application is used by a single organisation entity, the user access will be linked to a single organisation.
