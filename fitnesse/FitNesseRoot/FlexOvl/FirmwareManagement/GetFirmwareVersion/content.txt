!2 Narrative
As OSGP I want to get the firmware version info from a device

!3 ''NOTE: Authorisation is tested in Basic OSGP Functions - PBI119''

!2 Implemented Scenarios:
 * Successfully get firmware version
 * Unsuccessfully get firmware version

!2 Scenario: Successfully get firmware version
-| scenario | get firmware version success matrix | device | | status | | firmwareversion | | ismessagesent || result || description |
|given|a get firmware version request for device @device                                                                               |
|and  |the get firmware version request refers to a device @device with status @status                                                 |
|and  |the get firmware version request refers to an organisation that is authorised                                                   |
|and  |the get firmware version oslp message from the device contains @firmwareversion                                                 |
|when |the get firmware version request is received                                                                                    |
|then |the get firmware version request should return an async response with a correlationId and deviceId @device                      |
|and  |a get firmware version oslp message is sent to device @device should be @ismessagesent                                          |
|and  |an ovl get firmware version message with result @result and firmwareversion @firmwareversion should be sent to the ovl out queue|


-| get firmware version success matrix | 
|device   |status|firmwareversion|ismessagesent|result|description|
|device-01|active|R01            |true         |OK    |           |
|device-01|active|R02            |true         |OK    |           |
|device-01|active|               |true         |OK    |           |

!2 Parameters:
 * device: device identification
 * status: active, unknown, unregistered; should always be active for success scenario
 * firmwareversion: the firmware version
 * correlationId: correlationId of the message
 * isgenerated: boolean (true/false) indicating whether a correlationID is generated
 * isqueued: boolean (true/false) indicating whether a message is added to the queue
 * result: OK (correlationID is returned) or exception

 
 

!2 Scenario: Unsuccessfully get firmware version
-| scenario | get firmware version failure matrix | device | | status | | oslpresponse | | ismessagesent |
|given|a get firmware version request for device @device                                     |
|and  |the get firmware version request refers to a device @device with status @status       |
|and  |the get firmware version request refers to an organisation that is authorised         |
|when |the get firmware version request is received                                          |
|then |a get firmware version oslp message is sent to device @device should be @ismessagesent|


-| get firmware version failure matrix |
|device   |status      |oslpresponse|ismessagesent|
|device-01|unknown     |N/A         |false        |
|device-01|unregistered|N/A         |false        |

!3 ''NOTE: Device Message Status not implemented in protocol??? Therefore the following tests cannot be performed...''

 * |device-01|active      |FAILURE     |true         |DEVICEMESSAGEFAILEDEXCEPTION  |
 * |device-01|active      |REJECTED    |true         |DEVICEMESSAGEREJECTEDEXCEPTION|

!2 Parameters:
 * device: device identification
 * status: active, unknown, unregistered, ???
 * isgenerated: boolean (true/false) indicating whether a correlationID is generated
 * isqueued: boolean (true/false) indicating whether a message is added to the queue
 * result: OK (correlationID is returned) or exception



!2 Scenario: Receive A Get Firmware Response Request
-| scenario | get firmware response input values | correlationid || deviceid || isfound || deviceid2 || qresult || qdescription || firmwareversion || result || description|
|given|a get firmware version response request with correlationId @correlationid and deviceId @deviceid                                                                                                                |
|and  |a get firmware version response message with correlationId @correlationid, deviceId @deviceid2, qresult @qresult, qdescription @qdescription and firmwareversion @firmwareversion is found in the queue @isfound|
|when |the get firmware version response request is received                                                                                                                                                           |
|then |the get firmware version response request should return a firmware response with result @result, description @description and firmwareversion @firmwareversion                                                  |
