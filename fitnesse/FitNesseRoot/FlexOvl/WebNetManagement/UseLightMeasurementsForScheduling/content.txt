!2 Narrative
As an owner I want to use light measurements for scheduling

!2 Scenario: Set light measurement device for devices
|given|a list of devices                                      |
|when |selecting a device                                     |
|and  |selecting a light measurement device                   |
|then |the light measurement device will be set for the device|
|and  |the result will be shown on the screen                 |

!2 Scenario: Receive light measurement sms messages
|given|an incoming sms with from and to phone numbers, and body                                          |
|when |the incoming sms is received                                                                      |
|then |the to phone number is validated                                                                  |
|and  |the concerned devices are determined by the light measurement device identification               |
|and  |the transition type is determined from the sms body                                               |
|and  |a transition message is placed in a message queue (osgp.netmanagement.transitions) for each device|

!2 Scenario: Process light measurement sms messages
|given|a transition message in the message queue                                            |
|when |the message is picked up from the queue                                              |
|then |a set transition message is sent to OSGP                                              |
|and  |a correlationUid is returned                                                         |
|and  |the correlationUid is placed in a message queue (osgp.netmanagement.pending.requests)|

!2 Scenario: Process light measurement correlationUid's to get results
|given|a correlationUid in the queue (osgp.netmanagement.pending.requests)|
|when |getting the response using the correlationUid                      |
|and  |the result isn't NOT FOUND (in case we poll again for a response)  |
|then |the result can be OK or NOT OK which will be logged in a log file  |
