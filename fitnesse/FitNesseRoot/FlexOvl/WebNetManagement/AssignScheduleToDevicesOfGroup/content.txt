!2 Narrative
As a net management application I want to assign schedules to the list of devices of  a group

!2 Scenario: assign schedule (light or tariff) to the devices identified by a group
|given|an authorised user                                                                        |
|when |the user navigates to the groups page                                                     |
|and  |the user chooses a light or tariff schedule to assign to the devices of the selected group|
|then |the chosen schedule will be assigned to the devices of the selected group                 |


!3 Note: if (at some point in the past) a schedule has been assigned to a device, the schedule will be overwritten for the device
!3 Note: the chosen schedule is not persisted within the group, therefore the User Interface cannot show the current schedule for the devices in a group
