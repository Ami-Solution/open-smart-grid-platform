!2 Narrative
As a user I want to log in to a web application, web operator, web owner, web installation, etc.

!3 Description
The WebUserManagement offers authentication for a user's credentials. The user will be issued
a token after a successful login. The token is authenticated before each action of the user. If
the token is no longer correct, or no longer valid, the user is forced to log back in.
