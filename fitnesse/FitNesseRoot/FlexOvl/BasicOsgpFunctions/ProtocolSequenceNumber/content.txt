!2 Narrative
In order to make installed devices communicate in a secure way, sequence numbers are present in the protocol. 
This prevents replay-attacks.
The device will register once every 24 hours. The device generates a random sequence number and a random value 'randomDevice'.
The platform will receive the register request and will use the same sequence number and 'randomDevice' value and the platform will generate a random value 'randomPlatform' to create a response.
The device will receive the response and will issue a confirm device registration request, using an incremented sequence number, along with the 'randomDevice' and 'randomPlatform' values.

!2 Note
The sequence number has a range of 0 to 65535 (2^16 - 1).
The two random values 'randomDevice' and 'randomPlatform' have the same range.
The sequence number window has a value of 6.

!2 Scenario: Register device that already exists on the platform.
-| script |
|given|a valid register device OSLP message                                   |
|and  |an existing device with initial sequence number                        |
|when |the register device request is received                                |
|then |the device should contain an expected - equal to init - sequence number|
|and  |the device should have both random values set                          |

!2 Scenario: Confirm device registration.

|when |the confirm device registration request is received                  |
|then |the device should contain an expected - incremented - sequence number|

!2 Scenario: Confirm device registration using different sequence numbers and sequence window.
