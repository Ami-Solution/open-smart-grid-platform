!2 Narrative
As an OSGP client I want to retrieve received event notifications of a device

!2 Scenario: Successfully retrieve event notification
-| scenario | example | organisation | | device | | timestamp | | eventtype | | description | | index |
|given|an OSGP client @organisation                                                                                |
|and  |an authorized device @device                                                                               |
|and  |a received event notification @eventtype, @description and @index from @device                             |
|and  |a retrieve event notification request                                                                      |
|when |the retrieve event notification request is received                                                        |
|then |the OSGP should send an event notification response                                                         |
|and  |the response should contain the event notification @timestamp, @device, @eventtype, @description and @index|

-| example |
|organisation      |device |timestamp          |eventtype            |description|index|
|!-GemeenteArnhem-!|device1|2013-01-16 12:00:00|LIGHT_EVENTS_LIGHT_ON|Light is on|1    |
|!-GemeenteArnhem-!|device1|2013-01-16 12:00:00|TARIFF_EVENTS_TARIFF_ON|Tariff is on|1    |


!2 Scenario: Retrieve multiple event notifications
-| scenario | example paged | organisation | | device | | totalNumber | | pageSize | | requestedPage | | totalPages | | number |
|given|an OSGP client @organisation                                                                    |
|and  |an authorized device @device                                                                   |
|and  |a retrieve event notification request with requested page @requestedPage and pageSize @pageSize|
|and  |@totalNumber received event notifications                                                      |
|when |the retrieve event notification request is received                                            |
|then |the OSGP should send an event notification response                                             |
|and  |the response should contain total number of pages @totalPages                                  |

NOTE: default values in service  pageSize: 50 pageSizeLimit: 300 requestedPage: 1

-| example paged |
|organisation      |device |totalNumber|pageSize|requestedPage|totalPages|number|
|!-GemeenteArnhem-!|device1|0          |10      |1            |0         |0     |
|!-GemeenteArnhem-!|device1|1          |10      |1            |1         |1     |
|!-GemeenteArnhem-!|device1|15         |10      |1            |2         |10    |
|!-GemeenteArnhem-!|device1|15         |10      |2            |2         |5     |
|!-GemeenteArnhem-!|device1|500        |400     |1            |2         |300   |

!2 Scenario: Retrieve filtered event notifications
-| scenario | example filtered | organisation | | device | | timestamp | | filterDevice | | fromTimestamp | | toTimestamp | | result |
|given|an OSGP client @organisation                                                                |
|and  |a retrieve event notification request                                                      |
|and  |an authorized device @device                                                               |
|and  |a received event notification at @timestamp from @device                                   |
|and  |the event notification must be filtered on @filterDevice, @fromTimestamp, and @toTimestamp,|
|when |the retrieve event notification request is received                                        |
|then |the OSGP should send an event notification response                                         |
|and  |the response should contain @result event notifications                                    |

-| example filtered |
|organisation|device |timestamp|filterDevice|fromTimestamp|toTimestamp|result|
|Heerlen     |device1|10:00    |EMPTY       |EMPTY        |EMPTY      |1     |
|Heerlen     |device1|10:00    |device1     |EMPTY        |EMPTY      |1     |
|Heerlen     |device1|10:00    |EMPTY       |10:00        |11:00      |1     |
|Heerlen     |device1|10:00    |EMPTY       |10:00        |11:00      |1     |
|Heerlen     |device1|10:00    |EMPTY       |9:00         |11:00      |1     |
|Heerlen     |device1|10:00    |EMPTY       |9:00         |EMPTY      |1     |
|Heerlen     |device1|10:00    |EMPTY       |EMPTY        |10:00      |1     |

!2 Note
The following scenario fails, because the OSLP event notification does not have a timestamp and the creationTime of the entity is used. creationTime is set during construction of the entity and cannot be manipulated from the outside. Suggested solution: incorporate a timestamp in the OSLP event notification message.

|organisation|device |timestamp|filterDevice|fromTimestamp|toTimestamp|result|
|Heerlen     |device1|10:00    |device1     |9:00         |10:00      |0     |
|Heerlen     |device1|10:00    |device2     |EMPTY        |EMPTY      |0     |
