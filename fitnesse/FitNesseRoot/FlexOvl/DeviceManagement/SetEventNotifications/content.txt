!2 Narrative
As OSGP I want to set event notifications for a device

!2 Scenario: set event notifications
-| scenario | success input values | device | | notifications || ismessagesent||result||description           |
|given|a valid set event notifications request with @device and @notifications                                                           |
|and  |the set event notifications request refers to an existing device @device that will always respond OK                              |
|and  |the set event notifications request refers to an existing organisation that is authorized                                         |
|when |the set event notifications request is received on OSGP                                                                            |
|then |the set event notifications request should return an async response with a correlationId and deviceId @device                     |
|and  |a set event notifications oslp message is sent to device @device should be @ismessagesent                                         |
|and  |an ovl set event notifications result message with result @result and description @description should be sent to the ovl out queue|

-| success input values |
|device |notifications              |ismessagesent|result|description   |
|device1|LIGHT_EVENTS               |true         |OK    |              |
|device1|TARIFF_EVENTS              |true         |OK    |              |
|device1|COMM_EVENTS                |true         |OK    |              |
|device1|LIGHT_EVENTS, TARIFF_EVENTS|true         |OK    |              |

!2 Scenario: Receive A Get Set event notifications Response Request
-| scenario | get set event notifications response input values | correlationid || deviceid || isfound || deviceid2 || qresult || qdescription || result || description|
|given|a get set event notifications response request with correlationId @correlationid and deviceId @deviceid                                                                          |
|and  |a set event notifications response message with correlationId @correlationid, deviceId @deviceid2, qresult @qresult and qdescription @qdescription is found in the queue @isfound|
|when |the get set event notifications response request is received                                                                                                                     |
|then |the get set event notifications response request should return a set event notifications response with result @result and description @description                               |

-| get set event notifications response input values |
|correlationid|deviceid|isfound|deviceid2|qresult|qdescription    |result   |description     |
|cid-01       |dvc-01  |true   |dvc-01   |OK     |                |OK       |                |
|cid-02       |dvc-01  |false  |         |       |                |NOT_FOUND|                |
|cid-03       |dvc-01  |true   |dvc-01   |NOT_OK |VALIDATION ERROR|NOT_OK   |VALIDATION ERROR|

!2 Parameters:
 * correlationId: correlation Id returned from a set event notifications request
 * content: message content
 * result: OK or exception
