!2 Narrative
As a security officer I want the platform to be able to revoke the public key for a device

!2 Happy flow:

!3 Scenario: successfully revoke a key for existing device
-| scenario | success input values | device |
|given|a revoke key request with @device                                     |
|and  |the revoke key request refers to an existing device @device                 |
|and  |the revoke key request refers to an existing organisation that is authorized|
|when |the revoke key request is received on OSGP                                   |
|then |the device's key should be cleared                                          |
|and  |the revoke key request should return a revoke key response                  |
