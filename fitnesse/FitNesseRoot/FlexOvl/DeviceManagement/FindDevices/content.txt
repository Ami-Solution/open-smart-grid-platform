!2 Narrative

In order to offer the possibility to test a device
As an OSGP
I want to make sure a list of recently installed devices can be retrieved 

!2 Scenario: Find devices parameterized
-|scenario|example|device||ownerid||ownername||pagesize||page||number|                              
|given|a valid find devices request with pageSize @pagesize and page @page|
|and  |a device @device with ownerid @ownerid and ownername @ownername    |
|when |the find devices request is received                               |
|then |the find devices request should return a find devices response     |
|and  |the find devices response should contain @number device            |
|and  |the device in the response matches device @device                  |
