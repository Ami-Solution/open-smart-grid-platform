!2 Narrative
As a security officer I want the platform to be able to update public keys for each device

!2 Happy flow:

!3 Scenario: successfully update key for existing device
-| scenario | success input values | device | | key |
|given|an update key request with @device and @key                                 |
|and  |the update key request refers to an existing device @device                 |
|and  |the update key request refers to an existing organisation that is authorized|
|when |the update key request is received on OSGP                                   |
|then |the device's key should be updated to @key                                  |
|and  |an update key response should be returned                                   |
