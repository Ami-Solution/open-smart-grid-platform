!2 Narrative

As a platform I want to log requests and responses being made to the endpoints of the web services.

!2 Scenario: A web application calls an operation of an endpoint. 

|given|a valid organisation with organisationIdentification                                      |
|and  |the organisation calls a web service operation using valid input parameter(s)             |
|when |the operation in the endpoint creates the response                                        |
|then |the endpoint class name must be logged                                                    |
|and  |the endpoint method name must be logged                                                   |
|and  |the organisation identification of the organisation executing the operation must be logged|
|and  |the device identification of the request should be logged, if present                     |
|and  |the correlation uid of the request should be logged, if present                           |
|and  |the result of the response (OK, NOT OK or NOT FOUND) should be logged, if present         |
|and  |the data size in Bytes of the response must be logged                                     |
