In order to offer the possibility to test a device
As an OSP
I want to make sure a list of recently installed devices can be retrieved 

!2 Scenario: Find recent devices parameterized
-|scenario|example|device||hasschedule||number|                              
|given|a valid find recent devices request                                         |
|and  |a device @device with @hasschedule                                          |
|when |the find recent devices request is received                                 |
|then |the find recent devices request should return a find recent devices response|
|and  |the find recent devices response should contain @number device              |
|and |the device in the response matches device @device with hasschedule @hasschedule|
