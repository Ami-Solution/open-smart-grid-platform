!2 Narrative

In order to test the correct installation of a device
As a OSP I want to make sure the owner organisation can start a device test

!2 Implemented Scenarios:
 * Successfully start device test
 * Unsuccessfully start device test


!2 Scenario: Start device test

-| scenario | start device test succes matrix | device || organisation || status || ismessagesent || result || description |
|given|a start device test request for device @device                                                         |
|and  |the start device test request refers to a device @device with status @status                           |
|and  |the start device test request refers to an organisation @organisation                                  |
|and  |the start device test oslp message from the device                                                     |
|when |the start device test request is received                                                              |
|then |the start device test request should return an async response with a correlationId and deviceId @device|
|and  |a start device test oslp message is sent to device @device should be @ismessagesent                    |
|and  |an ovl start device test message with result @result should be sent to the ovl out queue               |


-| start device test succes matrix | 
|device   |organisation   |status|ismessagesent|result|description|
|device-01|ORGANISATION-01|active|true         |OK    |           |

!2 Parameters:
 * device: device identification
 * organisation: the organisation.
 * status: active, unknown, unregistered; should always be active for success scenario
 * correlationId: correlationId of the message
 * isgenerated: boolean (true/false) indicating whether a correlationID is generated
 * isqueued: boolean (true/false) indicating whether a message is added to the queue
 * result: OK (correlationID is returned) or exception


!2 Scenario: Start device test with incorrect parameters

-| scenario | start device test failure matrix | device || organisation || status || ismessagesent |
|given|a start device test request for device @device                                     |
|and  |the start device test request refers to a device @device with status @status       |
|and  |the start device test request refers to an organisation @organisation              |
|and  |the start device test oslp message from the device                                 |
|when |the start device test request is received                                          |
|then |a start device test oslp message is sent to device @device should be @ismessagesent|

-| start device test failure matrix |
|device   |organisation           |status |ismessagesent|
|device-01|ORGANISATION-01        |unknown|false        |
|device-01|ORGANISATION_ID_UNKNOWN|unknown|false        |
|device-01|ORGANISATION_ID_EMPTY  |unknown|false        |
|device-01|ORGANISATION_ID_SPACES |unknown|false        |


!2 Parameters:
 * device: device identification
 * organisation: the organisation; the constants are used in StartDeviceTestSteps
 * status: active, unknown, unregistered; should always be active for success scenario
 * isgenerated: boolean (true/false) indicating whether a correlationID is generated
 * isqueued: boolean (true/false) indicating whether a message is added to the queue
 * result: OK (correlationID is returned) or exception



!2 Scenario: Receive A Start Device Test Response Request
-| scenario | start device test response input values | correlationid || deviceid || isfound || deviceid2 || qresult || qdescription || result || description|
|given|a start device test response request with correlationId @correlationid and deviceId @deviceid                                                                              |
|and  |a start device test response message with correlationId @correlationid, deviceId @deviceid2, qresult @qresult and qdescription @qdescription is found in the queue @isfound|
|when |the start device test response request is received                                                                                                                         |
|then |the start device test response request should return a start device test response with result @result and description @description                                         |

-| start device test response input values |
|correlationid|deviceid |isfound|deviceid2|qresult|qdescription    |result   |description     |
|cid-01       |device-01|true   |device-01|OK     |                |OK       |                |
|cid-02       |device-01|false  |         |       |                |NOT_FOUND|                |
|cid-03       |device-01|true   |device-01|NOT_OK |VALIDATION ERROR|NOT_OK   |VALIDATION ERROR|

!2 Parameters:
 * correlationId: correlation Id returned from a start device test request
 * content: message content
 * result: OK or exception
