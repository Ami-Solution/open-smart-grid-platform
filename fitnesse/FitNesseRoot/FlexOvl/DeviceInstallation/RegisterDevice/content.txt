!2 Narrative
In order to make installed devices available and reachable As an OSP I want to make sure a device can register itself

!2 Scenario: A device which is installed and performs first time registration.
-| script |
|given|a valid register device OSLP message                                       |
|and  |a device that is installed but has not registered before                   |
|when |the register device request is received                                    |
|then |the device should be updated with new deviceUID, IP address and device type|
|and  |the register device request should return a register device response       |
|and  |the register response should contain the current UTC time                  |
|and  |the register response should contain GPS location from metadata            |
|and  |the register response should contain timezone of platform                  |

!2 Scenario: A device which performs subsequent registration.
-| script |
|given|a valid register device OSLP message                                       |
|and  |a device that is installed and has already registered on the platform      |
|when |the register device request is received                                    |
|then |the device should be updated with new deviceUID, IP address and device type|
|and  |the register device request should return a register device response       |
|and  |the register response should contain the current UTC time                  |
|and  |the register response should contain GPS location from metadata            |
|and  |the register response should contain timezone of platform                  |

!2 Scenario: Register device that already exists on the platform, without GPS metadata
-| script |
|given|a valid register device OSLP message                                       |
|and  |a device that is installed and has already registered on the platform      |
|and  |the device has no metadata for GPS                                         |
|when |the register device request is received                                    |
|then |the device should be updated with new deviceUID, IP address and device type|
|and  |the register device request should return a register device response       |
|and  |the register response should contain the current UTC time                  |
|and  |the register response should NOT contain GPS location from metadata        |
|and  |the register response should contain timezone of platform                  |

!2 Scenario: Register device that does not yet exist on the platform
-| script |
|given|a valid register device OSLP message                    |
|and  |a device that does not yet exist on the platform        |
|when |the register device request is received                 |
|then |the device should not be created for security reasons   |
|and  |the register device request should not return a response|

!2 Scenario: Register device with network address already in use by another device
-| script |
|given|a valid register device OSLP message                                       |
|and  |a device that is installed and has already registered on the platform      |
|and  |another device exists using the same network address                       |
|when |the register device request is received                                    |
|then |the device should be updated with new deviceUID, IP address and device type|
|and  |the network address for the other device should be cleared                 |
|and  |the register device request should return a register device response       |
|and  |the register response should contain the current UTC time                  |
|and  |the register response should contain GPS location from metadata            |
|and  |the register response should contain timezone of platform                  |
