Feature: Connection security
  As a grid operator
  I want to communicate with devices at different levels of security
  So the transferred data is as secure as possible

  Scenario: Communicate with LLS1 encryption without sn and hdlc
    Given a dlms device

    When the get actual meter reads request is received
      | DeviceIdentification | TEST1024000000001 |
    Then the actual meter reads result should be returned
      | DeviceIdentification | TEST1024000000001 |

#The simulator doesn't support sn and hdlc yet.
#When the Kenter meters will be officially supported the decision can be made to have the simulator
#adjusted by Fraunhofer to implement sn and hdlc for the simulator.
