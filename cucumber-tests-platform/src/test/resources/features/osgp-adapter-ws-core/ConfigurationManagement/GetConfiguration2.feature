  Scenario Outline: Get configuration data with invalid data
    Given an oslp device
      | DeviceIdentification | TEST1024000000001 |
      | DeviceType           | SSLD              |
    And the device returns a get configuration status over OSLP
      | Status            | OK                  |
      | LightType         | <LightType>         |
      | DcLights          | <DcLights>          |
      | DcMap             | <DcMap>             |
      | RcType            | <RcType>            |
      | RcMap             | <RcMap>             |
      | PreferredLinkType | <PreferredLinkType> |
      | MeterType         | <MeterType>         |
      | ShortInterval     | <ShortInterval>     |
      | LongInterval      | <LongInterval>      |
      | IntervalType      | <IntervalType>      |
    When receiving a get configuration request
      | DeviceIdentification | TEST1024000000001 |
    Then the get configuration async response contains soap fault
      | FaultCode        | <FaultCode>        |
      | FaultString      | <FaultString>      |
      | ValidationErrors | <ValidationErrors> |
